function agglo = removeSoma(agglo, soma)
    % agglo = removeSoma(agglo, soma)
    %   Removes all soma-overlapping segments from a super-agglomerate. If
    %   the super-agglomerate is split into multiple connected components,
    %   the components are joined via a non-segment node placed at the
    %   center-of-mass of the soma.
